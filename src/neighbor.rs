//! Neighbor search utilities.
//!
//! This module contains stubs for a future grid or spatial hashing based
//! neighbor search. Currently the simulation performs an all-pairs search
//! in `force::compute_forces`.

/// Build the neighbor list for all particles.
///
/// The implementation is left as future work.
pub fn build_neighbor_list() {
    // To be implemented: grid-based neighbor search or spatial hashing
